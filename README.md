# mcp-federator
MCP-Federator is a federated Model Context Protocol (MCP) agent that connects to multiple upstream MCP servers, aggregates or proxies their model contexts, and re-exposes them through a unified MCP-compatible interface. It acts as both a client and a server, enabling centralized access to distributed model context data.
